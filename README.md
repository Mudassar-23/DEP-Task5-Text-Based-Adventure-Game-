Text-Based Adventure Game – C++
This project is a text-based adventure game written in C++. Players explore different paths, make choices, and interact with the environment. 
The game features branching narratives with multiple outcomes, character interactions, and real-time decision-making elements.

Game Overview
In the game, the player wakes up in a dark forest with no memory of how they got there. They must navigate through various scenarios and make decisions to progress. 
Players will encounter a bear, a dragon, and friendly villagers. Depending on the choices made, the player can either win the game or face game over situations.

Features
Branching narratives: Explore multiple paths (Forest, Cave, Village) with different outcomes.
Character interactions: Encounter wild creatures and interact with villagers.
Game mechanics: Decisions lead to different endings – win, restart, or game over.
Realistic feel: ANSI color-coded text output enhances immersion.
